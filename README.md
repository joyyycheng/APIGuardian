# API Guardian

API Guardian is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to scan your project for APIs. Once the APIs are identified, they will be tested, and a report will be generated containing the full API, its file location, status, and a corresponding message. Developers can also hover over the APIs found in their project a pop-up messaage will appear based on the status of your API. This extension currently works for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, CSharp and PHP. This extension streamlines debugging and testing, reducing manual effort and allowing you to focus more on development.

## Features

This project is part of a learning experience, and while we continuously work to enhance its functionality, we cannot guarantee specific performance outcomes or results. We appreciate your understanding and support as we refine this extension.

As a limitation, the extension can scan GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE API endpoints in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. However, for C#, PHP, and Java, it currently supports scanning only GET API endpoints.


- Scan your project for APIs, below are examples of the type of API we are able to scan
    1. http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key={apikey}&q={country}&days={number_of_days}
    2. https://eventregistry.org/api/v1/minuteStreamArticles?lang=eng&recentActivityArticlesUpdatesAfterMinsAgo=240&isDuplicateFilter=skipDuplicates&apiKey={api_key}
    
- An Excel report containing this information will be generated and exported to your project.
    1. Number of APIs found in your project
    2. Number of Successfully tested APIs in your project
    3. Number of Failed tested APIs in your project
    4. Full APIs
    5. File Location of where the API was found
    6. Status of the API
    7. Message of the API

- Hover message when the developer mouse over the API found in the project
    1. To view recommended fix for any error occured in your API Endpoint, follow the steps in this link to create an API Key. https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
